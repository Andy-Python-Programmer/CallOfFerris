//! The Scene system is basically for transitioning between
//! *completely* different states that have entirely different game
//! loops and but which all share a state.  It operates as a stack, with new
//! scenes getting pushed to the stack (while the old ones stay in
//! memory unchanged).  Apparently this is basically a push-down automata.
//!
//! Also there's no reason you can't have a Scene contain its own
//! Scene subsystem to do its own indirection.  With a different state
//! type, as well!  What fun!  Though whether you want to go that deep
//! down the rabbit-hole is up to you.  I haven't found it necessary
//! yet.
//!
//! This is basically identical in concept to the Amethyst engine's scene
//! system, the only difference is the details of how the pieces are put
//! together.
